this principle mainly focuses on interfaces rather than on classes
logic is do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them


an interface UPIPayments has following services
	
	1.payMoney
	2.GetScatchCard
	3.GetCashBackAsCreditBalance
	
consider two classes 

	1.paytm
	2.GooglePay 
	
google pay dosen't supports GetCashBackAsCreditBalance so we have to segregate interface to follow ISP
